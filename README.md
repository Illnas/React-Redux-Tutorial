React Redux Toolkit Tutorial by John Smilga

Another amazingly done tutorial by John Smilga. After going through a tutorial, I have to say,
I love Redux. This tutorial was done on a very good example and it shows benefits of having
state management library like Redux, in your project. 

Since I already have an example, I think it is time to revisit Checkout System, and implement
Redux and implement a better design.

So, onwards to another project.
